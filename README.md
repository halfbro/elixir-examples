# elixir-examples
Sample projects to go along with an introductory talk to Elixir

`master` contains the final version of each sample - you can find intermediate code in the different branches, if it applies.

Most information was taken from the [Elixir homepage](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) or the [Elixir Standard Library](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html)
